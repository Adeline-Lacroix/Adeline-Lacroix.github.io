## Sex and Gender Differences in Autism
My research focused on autism, with a particular interest in understanding and characterizing sex and gender differences. 
Historically, autistic females have been underdiagnosed and under-researched, resulting in challenges in accessing appropriate care. 
By describing their specific profiles, we can help ensure better diagnosis and support for them.

During my PhD at the [Laboratory of Psychology and NeuroCognition (LPNC)](https://lpnc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en) in Grenoble, France, I studied these differences in the context of emotional face processing through the lens of the predictive brain model ([PREDEMAUT](/projects/001_Predemaut) project). 
I conducted behavioral and EEG experiments.

In my first postdoctoral position at the LPNC, I further explored sex and gender differences in autism in relation to school participation ([PARTDIAG-TSA](/projects/002_PartDiag_TSA) project). 
We also launched the [FLEXPREAUT](/projects/004_Flexpreaut) project, which aims to better understand the neural mechanisms of the predictive brain in autism through flexibility tasks and fMRI, continuing to focus on sex and gender differences.

I am now a postdoctoral fellow at the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute (at the [CAMH](https://www.camh.ca) - Toronto, Canada), conducting the [INFORMHA-f](/projects/007_INFORMHA-f) project.
It aims to investigate how autistic females fits within the neurobiological and clinical heterogenity of the autism spectrum, using large databases and normative modeling. 
Part of my research also deal with health in autistic females.

## Participatory Research
Another key aspect of my work is the development of participatory research on autism in France. 
In this context, I co-led the [PARAUTIS](/projects/003_Parautis) research project on parenting among autistic individuals at [iMind](https://centre-imind.fr/?lang=en) (Lyon, France). 
I am also involved in other participatory research projects, such as the [AUTISENCITE](/projects/005_Autisencité) project, related to the sensory perception in urban environments.

Additionally, I am part of a working group in the [Autism and NDD GIS](https://autisme-neurodev.org/en/) dedicated to establishing a school for participatory research. This initiative aims to provide a better framework for participatory research in France and to enhance the education of both researchers and autistic individuals.
